MAX31856 Precision Thermocouple to Digital Converter with Linearization

General Description
The MAX31856 performs cold-junction compensation and digitizes the signal from any type of thermocouple. 
The output data is formatted in degrees Celsius.
This converter resolves temperatures to 0.0078125°C, allows readings as high as +1800°C and as low as -210°C (depending on thermocouple type), and exhibits thermocouple voltage measurement accuracy of ±0.15%.
The thermocouple inputs are protected against overvoltage conditions up to ±45V.
A lookup table (LUT) stores linearity correction data for several types of thermocouples (K, J, N, R, S, T, E, and B).
Line frequency filtering of 50Hz and 60Hz is included, as is thermocouple fault detection.
A SPI-compatible interface allows selection of thermocouple type and setup of the conversion and fault detection processes.
